# Event Message Contract Map

Task: `ART-111_EVENT_MAP`
Generated at: `2026-07-28T09:18:23+00:00`
Target root: `/home/flexnetos/FlexNetOS`

## Scope

This map records event and message contracts found in the target filesystem and envctl migration database artifacts. It covers topics or streams, queues, payload records, producers, consumers, retry semantics, and dead-letter or failure handling. Static source matches are evidence candidates; durable contract rows come from the envctl database and shared protocol manifests.

## Contract Summary

| topic | queue or stream | payload | producers | consumers | retry | DLQ or failure path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `envctl.migration.run_events` | append-only hash-chained event stream | `schemas/run_event.schema.json and shared_protocol.RunEvent` | envctl mutating migration commands with --emit-event | nu_plugin envctl migration events, nu_plugin status stream, live timeline view | idempotent command retry keyed by operation/run id; replay validates event and proof hashes | invalid or blocked events remain in operation/evidence failure surfaces; failed_ops/open_approvals views expose remediation |
| `envctl.migration.operations` | operation queue | `shared_protocol.Operation` | task packets, envctl command execution, artifact generators | envctl operation state machine, nu_plugin ops/status commands, artifact registry producer checks | idempotency_key plus command_hash prevents duplicate unsafe work | failed operation status, error_ref, rollback handles, and validation evidence become the remediation queue |
| `envctl.migration.artifacts` | artifact registry event surface | `shared_protocol.ArtifactRecord and EvidenceRecord` | artifact generation tasks including ART-111 | validation tasks, proof ledger merge, readiness scorecard | content hash recomputation and ON CONFLICT upserts keep artifact registration repeatable | blocked paths, mismatched hashes, and foreign producer operations are rejected fail-closed |
| `envctl.migration.approvals` | human approval queue | `shared_protocol.ApprovalRequest and ApprovalDecision` | risk-bearing envctl operations | nu_plugin approve/deny commands, operation state machine, run ledger | approval decision events are append-only and tied to operation id | denied/expired/blocked approvals halt execution until the operator records a decision |
| `envctl.migration.validation` | validation evidence ledger | `shared_protocol.ValidationResult` | verification commands and artifact registry validators | VER-300_UNIT_VALIDATION, readiness scorecard, proof ledger | validation commands are rerunnable and reference immutable evidence hashes | fail/warn/blocked statuses carry next_action through proof and evidence records |

- Run event columns: `id, run_id, event_seq, event_type, phase, actor_type, actor_id, operation_id, payload_json, evidence_refs_json, previous_event_hash, event_hash, created_at_utc`
- Operation columns: `id, run_id, parent_operation_id, operation_type, phase, status, risk, idempotency_key, command_hash, command_redacted, input_json, output_ref, error_json, started_at_utc, completed_at_utc, created_at_utc`
- nu_plugin event command count: `12`

## Scan Limits

- Files scanned: `3000`
- Max files: `3000`
- Max file bytes: `700000`
- Truncated: `True`
- Skipped: `{"max_files_reached": 1, "too_large": 8, "unsupported_suffix": 399}`

## Validation

- Artifact registry persisted paths and content hashes for the canonical markdown, task markdown, and task JSON artifacts.
- Blocked path policy excluded `.env`, `secrets`, `private_keys`, `*.pem`, and `*.key` paths.
- Validation links include registry hash checks, shared protocol coverage, and required contract map sections.
