# ART-116 Infrastructure Topology Map

Generated: `2026-07-27T21:38:36+00:00`

This map is built from the target descriptor, generated repo/package scan, envctl database reports, and a safe filename-only scan of the target filesystem. It records repo evidence and database control-plane topology; it does not claim live cloud/runtime inventory unless that evidence is present.

## Target

- Target: `flexnetos-vs-lifeos`
- Primary root: `/home/flexnetos/FlexNetOS`
- Compare root: `/home/flexnetos/lifeos`
- Target registry status: `passed`
- Safe scan visited files: `9984`

## Gaps

| Category | Gap | Next evidence needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| load_balancers | No safe-scan filesystem evidence found for this infrastructure category. | Collect runtime inventory, IaC state, or deployment platform export for this category. |

## Evidence Boundary

- Secret-like paths are excluded by policy: `**/.env`, `**/secrets/**`, `**/private_keys/**`, `**/*.pem`, `**/*.key`.
- The envctl migration database is represented from generated schema/report artifacts and is exercised as SQLite in-memory in this execution framework.
- Load balancer, DNS, firewall, and certificate rows are evidence categories, not confirmed deployed infrastructure, unless backed by runtime inventory in a later artifact.
