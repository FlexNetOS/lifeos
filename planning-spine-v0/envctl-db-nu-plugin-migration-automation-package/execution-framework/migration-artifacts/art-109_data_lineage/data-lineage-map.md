# Data Lineage Map

Task: `ART-109_DATA_LINEAGE`
Generated at: `2026-07-27T04:55:13+00:00`
Target root: `/home/flexnetos/FlexNetOS`

## Scope

This map traces critical migration fields from their schema or database origin, through static transformation evidence, to consuming protocol records, registry views, plugin-facing records, and proof artifacts. Blocked secret and private-key paths are excluded from the scan.

## Summary

| measure | value |
|---|---:|
| field count | 183 |
| critical field count | 27 |
| sql table count | 16 |
| schema source count | 37 |
| target files scanned | 2500 |
| fields with target references | 44 |
| protocol record count | 14 |
