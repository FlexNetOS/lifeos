# Code Map For Debugging

Task: `ART-113_DEBUG_CODE_MAP`
Generated at: `2026-07-27T04:56:55+00:00`
Target root: `/home/flexnetos/FlexNetOS`

## Scope

This is a static debugging map for the target filesystem. It records entry points, control-flow candidates, external calls, error and retry paths, logging, metrics or alert signals, and runbook references. Dynamic dispatch and generated runtime behavior are marked as static candidates by design.

## Scan Summary

| signal | count |
|---|---:|
| entry point count | 160 |
| control flow count | 160 |
| external call count | 160 |
| error path count | 160 |
| log signal count | 160 |
| metrics alert count | 160 |
| runbook signal count | 160 |
| hotspot count | 80 |
